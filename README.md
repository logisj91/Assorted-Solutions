# Assorted Solutions
A collection of work examples by me. Due to working with classified information and team projects, I cannot upload entire work projects to GitHub, I will instead upload summaries of tasks completed.

# Customer Creation Script
This script was created by me, for a startup organization needing to automate certain parts of their customer intake. This was my first foray into a DevOps type workflow, even though it does not contain much in way of modern technologies.

# CI/CD Pipeline in Azure 
For automating build and deployment of a Resource Group and associated resources, including Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics. Technologies used consist of YAML, PowerShell scripts, ARM Templates and Terraform code.
